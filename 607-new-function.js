/* Functions created with new Function, have [[Environment]] referencing the global Lexical Environment, not the outer one. Hence, they cannot use outer variables. 
But thatâ€™s actually good, because it saves us from errors. 
Passing parameters explicitly is a much better method architecturally and causes no problems with minifiers.
